## Unreleased

### Added

- Customisable push reminder frequency: every hour, every 2 hours, or once per day
- Default reminder window for new users: 7am–7pm, hourly
- Settings tab in bottom nav with personal and group admin sections
- Training plan wizard saves daily target and syncs to Log screen and push reminders

### Changed

- **Log page overhaul:** progress and ring at top, sticky bank bar above nav, today's entries scroll below without fighting fixed chrome
- Bottom nav flattened — Log stays centred with accent pill but no longer floats over page content
- Group tab focuses on members; admin tools (join requests, invites, billing) moved to Settings
- Training wizard recommends a personalised daily target from max clean set (conservative formula)
- Existing users keep once-daily reminders until they change frequency in Settings

### Fixed

- Scrolling today's entries no longer accidentally taps the Log tab (removed overlapping hero FAB)
- Circular logger rep feedback via [bzzz](https://pavlito.github.io/bzzz/) — haptics when available, audio tick fallback on Chrome mobile and iOS
- Keyboard increment haptics use a synchronously updated count ref so rapid key repeat does not double-tick
- Bottom nav height token matches flat bar (no overflow FAB padding)
- Restored Android safe-area inset on bottom nav (3rem minimum) after layout regression
- Log page uses fixed bank strip above nav with scroll padding instead of sticky mid-page block
- CI: Node 22 on GitHub Actions; dependency bumps (Vite 6, ESLint 9, typescript-eslint 8.62, Supabase, react-router, Playwright, Vitest) clear high-severity `npm audit` failures

## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- Per-rep haptic feedback while dragging the circular logger (one tick per push-up; pattern when crossing multiple reps quickly)
- Handle snap animation on each rep during drag for clearer tactile feedback

### Notes

- Haptics use the Web Vibration API where supported (typically Android Chrome). iOS Safari often does not vibrate for web apps; visual handle snap still applies.

### Changed

- Ongoing mobile UI polish, performance, and security hardening during beta

### Fixed

- Invite join flow, member list visibility, auth session persistence on mobile

- Today screen mobile layout and stale PWA cache refresh behaviour

### Security

- Security hardening pass: cron auth for push reminders, billing column protection, expanded RLS tests, CDN security headers
